Machine Learning Tutorial on Gold Price Prediction with Python

Gold has always held a prominent place in the country’s economy and among the people. In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning tutorial on Gold Price Prediction with Python.

## Gold Price Prediction

Gold prices have historically skyrocketed, peaking at $ 1,800 in 2020. These swings that gold has faced can be attributed to several events that occurred during the period. Stock prices are strongly correlated with public information and world events, and gold is no exception.


Unlike other financial assets, precious metals behave positively in times of crisis. Indeed, in the face of events such as epidemics, wars and economic disruption, most assets experience a decline in their value. However, in search of cover, investors are turning their attention to gold. As a result, the demand for yellow metal increases, resulting in a rise in the market valuation.

Gold tends to be viewed as a strategic and tactical investment asset when considering portfolio diversification. However, the economic and financial aspects are not the only factors that can affect gold prices. Geopolitical factors may also influence the valuation of the yellow metal’s market.

Indeed, show that faced with geopolitical risks, gold acts as a safe haven. In fact, he has an affirmative reaction in times of threats resulting from geopolitical and international tensions. By analyzing financial, geopolitical and global data on natural disasters, it is possible to predict future fluctuations in the price of gold, which will allow investors to improve the management of their portfolio in the face of unexpected movements. of the market.

# Gold Price Prediction with Python

## Overview
Unlock the potential of machine learning to predict gold prices with our Python tutorial. This project explores the impact of global events on gold prices, leveraging data and machine learning to forecast future trends.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses historical gold price data to predict future prices using Python.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzes how global events like epidemics and geopolitical tensions impact gold prices.

## Project Structure
- **gold.py**: Main Python script for training the prediction model.
- **gold_clean.csv**: Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
- **gold_price.csv**: Original dataset with historical gold prices.
- **gold_pred.png**: Visualization of the model's predictions.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meshalalsultan/Gold_Price_Prediction.git
    ```
2. **Install required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python gold.py
    ```

## How It Works
The script processes the gold price data, trains a machine learning model to recognize patterns, and predicts future prices. It also examines the influence of various global factors on gold's market price.
